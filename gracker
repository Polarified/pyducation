There is an info gathering script, that runs with uid level5.
We want to use this to get a shell.
What could be helpful would be to override the path and make uname, cut or find/-exec ls -la {} run something of my own.
However, I can't just add a script to the bin/sbin folders.
However, I can run certain things in a different environment.

So for this level we need to portscan with nmap, then connect with nc.
Found the port on 2989. Then nc'd to 127.0.0.1 2989, to run some stuff and then get kicked.
Copied and pasted a line, no clue what it does. But seemed interesting.
It gave me access, quickly wrote cat /home/level6/.pass.

For this level, I need to do a buffer overflow that will change the return address of the function.

Basic:
1: 2a6b7d28 (inspect element)
2: "" (there is no password)
3: 1d5de495 (changed mail to polarified)
4: a8e2f786 (changed mail to polarified)
5: 0a8cbbc5 (I did the same thing again. I guess on 4, people rewrote the form to do something else)
6: 73451920 (d = [chr(ord(c)-i) for i, c in enumerate(p)])
7: df17c5f7 (year; ls)
8: f1483499 (<!--#exec cmd="ls ../" -->)
9: 5dffd7e4 (the same as earlier, but with ../../9/ in the url to hop over to level 9)
10: go to cookies and change no to yes. Now any password works.
11: I cheated. Figured out directory listing, then got to a place where .htaccess isn't protected. Going to the file, found the answer.
Realistic:
Completed 1, sent a get request with a different vote (100)

Monoalphabetic non rotation cipher - This level was kind of too much. Not actually doable imo, required too much guessing.
krypton5: CLEARTEXT
Vignere Cipher - I really enjoyed this level. For some reason my frequency analysis didn't work all that well, so I got bad rotations. Watched a vid and I did everything right...
krypton6:
I think the idea would be to try to generate a whole bunch of different options with varying keylengths, and then slave over all the different options looking for things that match nicely.


Ideals I would like to follow:
Keep things remote, not local
Keep learning, all the time
Document things you learn

Data Structures

ADT - Abstract Data Types. The interface that needs to be implemented, regardless of the implementation itself.

Big-O Notation - an upper bound of complexity in the worst case, that helps to quantify performance as input size becomes arbitrarily large.

Arrays
Static Array: a container of size n, indexable from 0 to n-1.
Dynamic Array: an array that can grow and shrink in size, indexable as well.
Complexity:
Access = O(1) vs O(1)
Search = O(n) vs O(n)
Insertion = X vs O(n) (have to move everything)
Appending = X vs O(1)
Deleting = X vs O(n) (have to move everything)

Implement a Dynamic Array:
Create a static array with an initial size. When we reach maximum capacity, double the size and copy everything.
